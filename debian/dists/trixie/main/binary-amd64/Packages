 WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with
 much better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.
 .
 This modules provides xrdp sink / source for PulseAudio.
 .
 The server to client audio redirection is implemented as per Remote Desktop
 Protocol: Audio Output Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPEA] specs, which
 means it is interoperable with any RDP client which implements it (most of
 them including: MS RDP clients, FreeRDP).
